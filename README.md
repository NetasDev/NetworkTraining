# Selfplay Network Training for Turn-Based Games

This project tries to examine selfplay based learing for neural networks by documenting the training process and testing
the trained networks against each other and against the Minimax Algorithm.

Instructions for running the project via a conda environment will be added later on.





This Project is based on the code of the alpha-zero-general Project at https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general
